=head1 NAME

Bugzilla - Semi-persistent collection of various objects used by scripts
and modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Bugzilla;

  sub someModulesSub {
    Bugzilla->dbh->prepare(...);
    Bugzilla->template->process(...);
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Several Bugzilla 'things' are used by a variety of modules and scripts. This
includes database handles, template objects, and so on.

This module is a singleton intended as a central place to store these objects.
This approach has several advantages:

=over 4

=item *

They're not global variables, so we don't have issues with them staying around
with mod_perl

=item *

Everything is in one central place, so its easy to access, modify, and maintain

=item *

Code in modules can get access to these objects without having to have them
all passed from the caller, and the caller's caller, and....

=item *

We can reuse objects across requests using mod_perl where appropriate (eg
templates), whilst destroying those which are only valid for a single request
(such as the current user)

=back

Note that items accessible via this object are demand-loaded when requested.

For something to be added to this object, it should either be able to benefit
from persistence when run under mod_perl (such as the a C<template> object),
or should be something which is globally required by a large ammount of code
(such as the current C<user> object).

=head1 METHODS

Note that all C<Bugzilla> functionality is method based; use C<Bugzilla-E<gt>dbh>
rather than C<Bugzilla::dbh>. Nothing cares about this now, but don't rely on
that.

=over 4

=item C<template>

The current C<Template> object, to be used for output

=item C<cgi>

The current C<cgi> object. Note that modules should B<not> be using this in
general. Not all Bugzilla actions are cgi requests. Its useful as a convenience
method for those scripts/templates which are only use via CGI, though.

=item C<user>

C<undef> if there is no currently logged in user or if the login code has not
yet been run.  If an sudo session is in progress, the C<Bugzilla::User>
corresponding to the person who is being impersonated.  If no session is in
progress, the current C<Bugzilla::User>.

=item C<sudoer>

C<undef> if there is no currently logged in user, the currently logged in user
is not in the I<sudoer> group, or there is no session in progress.  If an sudo
session is in progress, returns the C<Bugzilla::User> object corresponding to
the person who logged in and initiated the session.  If no session is in
progress, returns the C<Bugzilla::User> object corresponding to the currently
logged in user.

=item C<sudo_request>
This begins an sudo session for the current request.  It is meant to be 
used when a session has just started.  For normal use, sudo access should 
normally be set at login time.

=item C<login>

Logs in a user, returning a C<Bugzilla::User> object, or C<undef> if there is
no logged in user. See L<Bugzilla::Auth|Bugzilla::Auth>, and
L<Bugzilla::User|Bugzilla::User>.

=item C<logout($option)>

Logs out the current user, which involves invalidating user sessions and
cookies. Three options are available from
L<Bugzilla::Constants|Bugzilla::Constants>: LOGOUT_CURRENT (the
default), LOGOUT_ALL or LOGOUT_KEEP_CURRENT.

=item C<logout_user($user)>

Logs out the specified user (invalidating all his sessions), taking a
Bugzilla::User instance.

=item C<logout_by_id($id)>

Logs out the user with the id specified. This is a compatibility
function to be used in callsites where there is only a userid and no
Bugzilla::User instance.

=item C<logout_request>

Essentially, causes calls to C<Bugzilla-E<gt>user> to return C<undef>. This has the
effect of logging out a user for the current request only; cookies and
database sessions are left intact.

=item C<batch>

Set to true, by calling Bugzilla->batch(1), to indicate that Bugzilla is
being called in a non-interactive manner and errors should be passed to 
die() rather than being sent to a browser and finished with an exit().
Bugzilla->batch will return the current state of this flag.

=item C<dbh>

The current database handle. See L<DBI>.

=item C<switch_to_shadow_db>

Switch from using the main database to using the shadow database.

=item C<switch_to_main_db>

Change the database object to refer to the main database.
