# This object models a set of relations between one item and a group
# of other items.  An example is the set of relations between one bug
# and the users CCed on that bug.  Currently, the relation objects are
# expected to be bugzilla userids.  However, this could and perhaps
# should be generalized to work with non userid objects, such as
# keywords associated with a bug.  That shouldn't be hard to do; it
# might involve turning this into a virtual base class, and having
# UserSet and KeywordSet types that inherit from it.

# Everything that uses Bugzilla::RelationSet should already have globals.pl
