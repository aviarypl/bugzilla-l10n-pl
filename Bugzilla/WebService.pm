=head1 NAME

Bugzilla::WebService - The Web Service interface to Bugzilla

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the standard API for external programs that want to interact
with Bugzilla. It provides various methods in various modules.

=head1 STABLE, EXPERIMENTAL, and UNSTABLE

Methods are marked B<STABLE> if you can expect their parameters and
return values not to change between versions of Bugzilla. You are 
best off always using methods marked B<STABLE>. We may add parameters
and additional items to the return values, but your old code will
always continue to work with any new changes we make. If we ever break
a B<STABLE> interface, we'll post a big notice in the Release Notes,
and it will only happen during a major new release.

Methods (or parts of methods) are marked B<EXPERIMENTAL> if 
we I<believe> they will be stable, but there's a slight chance that 
small parts will change in the future.

Certain parts of a method's description may be marked as B<UNSTABLE>,
in which case those parts are not guaranteed to stay the same between
Bugzilla versions.

=head1 ERRORS

If a particular webservice call fails, it will throw a standard XML-RPC
error. There will be a numeric error code, and then the description
field will contain descriptive text of the error. Each error that Bugzilla
can throw has a specific code that will not change between versions of
Bugzilla.

The various errors that functions can throw are specified by the
documentation of those functions.

If your code needs to know what error Bugzilla threw, use the numeric
code. Don't try to parse the description, because that may change
from version to version of Bugzilla.

Note that if you display the error to the user in an HTML program, make
sure that you properly escape the error, as it will not be HTML-escaped.

=head2 Transient vs. Fatal Errors

If the error code is a number greater than 0, the error is considered
"transient," which means that it was an error made by the user, not
some problem with Bugzilla itself.

If the error code is a number less than 0, the error is "fatal," which
means that it's some error in Bugzilla itself that probably requires
administrative attention.

Negative numbers and positive numbers don't overlap. That is, if there's
an error 302, there won't be an error -302.

=head2 Unknown Errors

Sometimes a function will throw an error that doesn't have a specific
error code. In this case, the code will be C<-32000> if it's a "fatal"
error, and C<32000> if it's a "transient" error.
