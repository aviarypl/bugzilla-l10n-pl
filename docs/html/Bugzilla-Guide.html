        configure, and therefore many people replace Sendmail with Postfix or

        ensure that the mail is delivered properly. They are implemented

>&#13;                    mod_perl support in Bugzilla can take up a HUGE amount of RAM. You could be
                    looking at 30MB per httpd child, easily. Basically, you just need a lot of RAM.
                    The more RAM you can get, the better. mod_perl is basically trading RAM for
                    speed. At least 2GB total system RAM is recommended for running Bugzilla under
                    mod_perl.

></H3
><P
>LDAP authentication is a module for Bugzilla's plugin 
      authentication architecture.
      </P
><P
>&#13;      The existing authentication
      scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses as the primary user ID, and a
      password to authenticate that user. All places within Bugzilla where
      you need to deal with user ID (e.g assigning a bug) use the email
      address. The LDAP authentication builds on top of this scheme, rather
      than replacing it. The initial log in is done with a username and
      password for the LDAP directory. Bugzilla tries to bind to LDAP using
      those credentials, and if successful, try to map this account to a
      Bugzilla account. If a  LDAP mail attribute is defined, the value of this
      attribute is used, otherwise emailsuffix parameter is appended to LDAP
      username to form a full email address. If an account for this address
      already exists in your Bugzilla system, it will log in to that account.
      If no account for that email address exists, one is created at the time
      of login. (In this case, Bugzilla will attempt to use the "displayName"
      or "cn" attribute to determine the user's full name.) After
      authentication, all other user-related tasks are still handled by email
      address, not LDAP username. You still assign bugs by email address, query
      on users by email address, etc.

    You will most probably like something like this:

      o conf makepl_arg "LIB=~/myperl/lib \
                         INSTALLMAN1DIR=~/myperl/man/man1 \
                         INSTALLMAN3DIR=~/myperl/man/man3"
    install Sybase::Sybperl

    You can make this setting permanent like all "o conf" settings with "o conf commit".

    You will have to add ~/myperl/man to the MANPATH environment variable and also tell your Perl programs to
    look into ~/myperl/lib, e.g. by including

      use lib "$ENV{HOME}/myperl/lib";

    or setting the PERL5LIB environment variable.

    Another thing you should bear in mind is that the UNINST parameter should never be set if you are not root.</PRE

            change to a bug, they will lock the entire table until the operation
            is complete. Locking for write also blocks reads until the write is
            complete. Note that more recent versions of mysql support row level
            locking using different table types. These types are slower than the
            standard type, and Bugzilla does not yet take advantage of features
            such as transactions which would justify this speed decrease. The
            Bugzilla team are, however, happy to hear about any experiences with
            row level locking and Bugzilla.

            shadow copy of the database. Although your database size will
            double, a shadow database can cause an enormous performance
            improvement when implemented on extremely high-traffic Bugzilla

></H3
><P
>&#13;        Bugzilla displays the version you are using at the top of the home
        page <TT
CLASS="filename"
>index.cgi</TT
>. It looks something like
        '2.20.3', '2.22.1' or '3.0rc1'. The first number in this series is
        the Major Version. This does not change very often;
        Bugzilla was 1.x.x when it was first created, and went to 2.x.x
        when it was re-written in perl in Sept 1998. The major version
        3.x.x, released in early 2007, is pretty far from what the 2.x.x
        series looked like, both about its UI and its code.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The second number in the version is called the 'minor number', and
        a release that changes the minor number is called a 'point release'.
        An even number in this position (2.18, 2.20, 2.22, 3.0, 3.2, etc.)
        represents a stable version, while an odd number (2.19, 2.21, 2.23, etc.)
        represents a development version. In the past, stable point releases
        were feature-based, coming when certain enhancements had been
        completed, or the Bugzilla development team felt that enough
        progress had been made overall. As of version 2.18, however,
        Bugzilla has moved to a time-based release schedule; current plans
        are to create a stable point release every 6 months or so after
        2.18 is deployed.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The third number in the Bugzilla version represents a bugfix version.
        Bugfix Revisions are released only to address security vulnerabilities
        and, for a limited period, bug fixes. Once enough of these
        bugfixes have accumulated (or a new security vulnerability is
        identified and closed), a bugfix release is made. As an
        example, 2.20.3 was a bugfix release, and improved on 2.20.2.

>&#13;        Each of these options has its own pros and cons; the one that's
        right for you depends on how long it has been since you last
        installed, the degree to which you have customized your installation,
        and/or your network configuration. (Some discussion of the various
        methods of updating compared with degree and methods of local

        Upgrading from 2.22 to 2.22.1 should be fairly painless even if
        you are heavily customized, but going from 2.18 to 3.0 is going
        to mean a fair bit of work re-writing your local changes to use
        the new files, logic, templates, etc. If you have done no local
        changes at all, however, then upgrading should be approximately
        the same amount of work regardless of how long it has been since
        your version was released.

>&#13;          If you are doing a bugfix upgrade -- that is, one where only the 
          last number of the revision changes, such as from 2.22 to 2.22.1
          -- then you have the option of obtaining and applying a patch file
          from the <A
HREF="http://www.bugzilla.org/download/"
TARGET="_top"
>Download Page</A
>.
          This file is made available by the <A
HREF="http://www.bugzilla.org/developers/profiles.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Bugzilla
          Development Team</A
>, and is a collection of all the bug fixes
          and security patches that have been made since the last bugfix
          release. If you are planning to upgrade via patches, it is safer
          to grab this developer-made patch file than to read the patch
          notes and apply all (or even just some of) the patches oneself,
          as sometimes patches on bugs get changed before they get checked in.
        </P
><P
>&#13;          As above, this example starts with obtaining the file via the 
          command line. If you have already downloaded it, you can omit the
          first two commands.

  run Bugzilla, it is all related to protecting your data. This is not
  intended to be a comprehensive guide to securing Linux, Apache, MySQL, or
  any other piece of software mentioned. There is no substitute for active
  administration and monitoring of a machine. The key to good security is
  actually right in the middle of the word: <EM

  </P

>While programmers in general always strive to write secure code,

  assume that the program you are working with isn't 100% secure and restrict

      audit your server and make sure that you aren't listening on any ports
      you don't need to be. It's also highly recommended that the server
      Bugzilla resides on, along with any other machines you administer, be
      placed behind some kind of firewall.

>&#13;        You can add and remove tags from individual bugs, which let you find and
        manage them more easily. Creating a new tag automatically generates a saved
        search - whose name is the name of the tag - which lists bugs with this tag.
        This saved search will be displayed in the footer of pages by default, as
        all other saved searches. The main difference between tags and normal saved
        searches is that saved searches, as described in the previous section, are
        stored in the form of a list of matching criteria, while the saved search
        generated by tags is a list of bug numbers. Consequently, you can easily
        edit this list by either adding or removing tags from bugs. To enable this
        feature, you have to turn on the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Enable tags for bugs"</SPAN
> user
        preference, see <A
HREF="#userpreferences"

>&#13;        This feature is useful when you want to keep track of several bugs, but
        for different reasons. Instead of adding yourself to the CC list of all
        these bugs and mixing all these reasons, you can now store these bugs in
        separate lists, e.g. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Keep in mind"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Interesting bugs"</SPAN
>,
        or <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Triage"</SPAN
>. One big advantage of this way to manage bugs
        is that you can easily add or remove bugs one by one, which is not
        possible to do with saved searches without having to edit the search
        criteria again.

>&#13;          Both charting forms require the administrator to set up the

>&#13;        An individual line on a chart is called a data set.
        All data sets are organised into categories and subcategories. The 
        data sets that Bugzilla defines automatically use the Product name 
        as a Category and Component names as Subcategories, but there is no 
        need for you to follow that naming scheme with your own charts if 
        you don't want to.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Data sets may be public or private. Everyone sees public data sets in
        the list, but only their creator sees private data sets. Only 
        administrators can make data sets public.
        No two data sets, even two private ones, can have the same set of 
        category, subcategory and name. So if you are creating private data 
        sets, one idea is to have the Category be your username.

>&#13;          You create a chart by selecting a number of data sets from the
          list, and pressing Add To List for each. In the List Of Data Sets
          To Plot, you can define the label that data set will have in the
          chart's legend, and also ask Bugzilla to Sum a number of data sets 
          (e.g. you could Sum data sets representing RESOLVED, VERIFIED and 
          CLOSED in a particular product to get a data set representing all 
          the resolved bugs in that product.)
        </P

>&#13;          If you've erroneously added a data set to the list, select it
          using the checkbox and click Remove. Once you add more than one 
          data set, a "Grand Total" line
          automatically appears at the bottom of the list. If you don't want
          this, simply remove it as you would remove any other line.
        </P
><P
>&#13;          You may also choose to plot only over a certain date range, and
          to cumulate the results - that is, to plot each one using the 
          previous one as a baseline, so the top line gives a sum of all 
          the data sets. It's easier to try than to explain :-)
        </P
><P
>&#13;          Once a data set is in the list, one can also perform certain 
          actions on it. For example, one can edit the
          data set's parameters (name, frequency etc.) if it's one you
          created or if you are an administrator.

>&#13;      A flag is a kind of status that can be set on bugs or attachments
      to indicate that the bugs/attachments are in a certain state.
      Each installation can define its own set of flags that can be set
      on bugs or attachments.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If your installation has defined a flag, you can set or unset that flag,
      and if your administrator has enabled requesting of flags, you can submit
      a request for another user to set the flag.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To set a flag, select either "+" or "-" from the drop-down menu next to
      the name of the flag in the "Flags" list.  The meaning of these values are
      flag-specific and thus cannot be described in this documentation,
      but by way of example, setting a flag named "review" to "+" may indicate
      that the bug/attachment has passed review, while setting it to "-"
      may indicate that the bug/attachment has failed review.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To unset a flag, click its drop-down menu and select the blank value.
      Note that marking an attachment as obsolete automatically cancels all
      pending requests for the attachment.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If your administrator has enabled requests for a flag, request a flag
      by selecting "?" from the drop-down menu and then entering the username
      of the user you want to set the flag in the text field next to the menu.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A set flag appears in bug reports and on "edit attachment" pages with the
      abbreviated username of the user who set the flag prepended to the
      flag name. For example, if Jack sets a "review" flag to "+", it appears
      as Jack: review [ + ]
    </P

>&#13;      A requested flag appears with the user who requested the flag prepended
      to the flag name and the user who has been requested to set the flag
      appended to the flag name within parentheses.  For example, if Jack
      asks Jill for review, it appears as Jack: review [ ? ] (Jill).

        you must make is how you want to go about doing so. There are two
        choices, and which you use depends mainly on the scope of your 
        modifications, and the method you plan to use to upgrade Bugzilla.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The first method of making customizations is to directly edit the
        templates found in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/default</TT
>.
        This is probably the best way to go about it if you are going to
        be upgrading Bugzilla through CVS, because if you then execute
        a <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs update</B
>, any changes you have made will
        be merged automagically with the updated versions.

        your changes will be lost.  This method may also be better if
        you are using the CVS method of upgrading and are going to make major
        changes, because it is guaranteed that the contents of this directory
        will not be touched during an upgrade, and you can then decide whether

>&#13;        The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of
        this guide. It's reasonably easy to pick up by looking at the current 
        templates; or, you can read the manual, available on the
        <A

      </P
><P
>&#13;        One thing you should take particular care about is the need
        to properly HTML filter data that has been passed into the template.
        This means that if the data can possibly contain special HTML characters
        such as &#60;, and the data was not intended to be HTML, they need to be
        converted to entity form, i.e. &#38;lt;.  You use the 'html' filter in the
        Template Toolkit to do this.  If you forget, you may open up
        your installation to cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Also note that Bugzilla adds a few filters of its own, that are not
        in standard Template Toolkit.  In particular, the 'url_quote' filter
        can convert characters that are illegal or have special meaning in URLs,
        such as &#38;, to the encoded form, i.e. %26.  This actually encodes most
        characters (but not the common ones such as letters and numbers and so
        on), including the HTML-special characters, so there's never a need to
        HTML filter afterwards.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Editing templates is a good way of doing a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"poor man's custom
        fields"</SPAN
>.
        For example, if you don't use the Status Whiteboard, but want to have
        a free-form text entry box for <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Build Identifier"</SPAN
>,
        then you can just
        edit the templates to change the field labels. It's still be called
        status_whiteboard internally, but your users don't need to know that.

        <TT

        formats of HTML (complex and simple). The mechanism that provides this

>&#13;        Bugzilla can support different types of output, which again can have 
        multiple formats. In order to request a certain type, you can append 
        the &#38;ctype=&#60;contenttype&#62; (such as rdf or html) to the 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#60;cginame&#62;.cgi</TT

        open a current template for
        that CGI and take note of the INTERFACE comment (if present.) This 
        comment defines what variables are passed into this template. If 
        there isn't one, I'm afraid you'll have to read the template and
        the code to find out what information you get.

>&#13;      Extensions are a way for extensions to Bugzilla to insert code
      into the standard Bugzilla templates and source files
      without modifying these files themselves.  The extension mechanism 
      defines a consistent API for extending the standard templates and source files 
      in a way that cleanly separates standard code from extension code.  
      Hooks reduce merge conflicts and make it easier to write extensions that work 
      across multiple versions of Bugzilla, making upgrading a Bugzilla installation 
      with installed extensions easier. Furthermore, they make it easy to install 
      and remove extensions as each extension is nothing more than a 
      simple directory structure. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      There are two main types of hooks: code hooks and template hooks. Code 
      hooks allow extensions to invoke code at specific points in various 
      source files, while template hooks allow extensions to add elements to 
      the Bugzilla user interface. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      A hook is just a named place in a standard source or template file
      where extension source code or template files for that hook get processed. 
      Each extension has a corresponding directory in the Bugzilla directory 
      tree (<TT
CLASS="filename"
>BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/extension_name</TT
>).  Hooking 
      an extension source file or template to a hook is as simple as putting 
      the extension file into extension's template or code directory. 
      When Bugzilla processes the source file or template and reaches the hook, 
      it will process all extension files in the hook's directory. 
      The hooks themselves can be added into any source file or standard template 
      upon request by extension authors.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      To use hooks to extend Bugzilla, first make sure there is
      a hook at the appropriate place within the source file or template you 
      want to extend. The exact appearance of a hook depends on if the hook 
      is a code hook or a template hook. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Code hooks appear in Bugzilla source files as a single method call 
      in the format <VAR
CLASS="literal"
>Bugzilla::Hook-&#62;process("<VAR
CLASS="varname"
>name</VAR
>");</VAR
>.
      For instance, <TT
CLASS="filename"
>enter_bug.cgi</TT
> may invoke the hook 
      "<VAR
CLASS="varname"
>enter_bug-entrydefaultvars</VAR
>". Thus, a source file at 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/EXTENSION_NAME/code/enter_bug-entrydefaultvars.pl</TT
>
      will be automatically invoked when the code hook is reached. 
    </P
><P
>  
      Template hooks appear in the standard Bugzilla templates as a 
      single directive in the format
      <VAR
CLASS="literal"
>[% Hook.process("<VAR
CLASS="varname"
>name</VAR
>") %]</VAR
>,
      where <VAR
CLASS="varname"
>name</VAR
> is the unique name of the hook.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      If you aren't sure what you want to extend or just want to browse the 
      available hooks, either use your favorite multi-file search
      tool (e.g. <B
CLASS="command"
>grep</B
>) to search the standard templates
      for occurrences of <CODE
CLASS="methodname"
>Hook.process</CODE
> or the source 
      files for occurrences of <CODE
CLASS="methodname"
>Bugzilla::Hook::process</CODE
>.

      name the hook, add it to the template or source file, and check 
      the new version of the template into CVS.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      You may optionally attach a patch to the bug which implements the hook
      and check it in yourself after receiving approval from a Bugzilla
      reviewer.  The developers may suggest changes to the location of the
      hook based on their analysis of your needs or so the hook can satisfy
      the needs of multiple extensions, but the process of getting hooks
      approved and checked in is not as stringent as the process for general
      changes to Bugzilla, and any extension, whether released or still in
      development, can have hooks added to meet their needs.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      After making sure the hook you need exists (or getting it added if not),
      add your extension to the directory within the Bugzilla
      extensions tree corresponding to the hook. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;      That's it!  Now, when the source file or template containing the hook
      is processed, your extension file will be processed at the point 
      where the hook appears.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      For example, let's say you have an extension named Projman that adds
      project management capabilities to Bugzilla.  Projman has an
      administration interface <TT
CLASS="filename"
>edit-projects.cgi</TT
>, 
      and you want to add a link to it into the navigation bar at the bottom
      of every Bugzilla page for those users who are authorized
      to administer projects.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      The navigation bar is generated by the template file
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>useful-links.html.tmpl</TT

      the <TT

      <TT
CLASS="filename"

      Looking in <TT

    </P

>&#13;      Now, let us say your extension adds a custom "project_manager" field 
      to enter_bug.cgi. You want to modify the CGI script to set the default 
      project manager to be productname@company.com. Looking at 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>enter_bug.cgi</TT

      hook near the bottom of the file before the default form values are set. 
      The corresponding extension source file for this hook is located at 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/projman/code/enter_bug-entrydefaultvars.pl</TT

      You then create that file and add the following:

      Assuming that the rest of the customization was completed (e.g. the 
      custom field was added to the enter_bug template and the required hooks 
      were used in process_bug.cgi), the new field will now have this 
      default value.

>&#13;          If your extension includes entirely new templates in addition to
          extensions of standard templates, it should store those new
          templates in its
          <TT
CLASS="filename"
>BUGZILLA_ROOT/extensions/template/en/</TT
> 
          directory. Extension template directories, like the 
          <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default/</TT

CLASS="filename"
>custom/</TT
>
          directories, are part of the template search path, so putting templates
          there enables them to be found by the template processor.
        </P
><P
>&#13;          The template processor looks for templates first in the
          <TT

          specific installation), then in the <TT

          <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default/</TT
> directory (i.e. the standard Bugzilla 
          templates). Thus, installation-specific templates override both 
          default and extension templates.

></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;          If you are looking to customize Bugzilla, you can also take advantage 
          of template hooks. To do so, create a directory in
          <TT
CLASS="filename"
>BUGZILLA_ROOT/template/en/custom/hook/</TT
>
          that corresponds to the hook you wish to use, then place your 
          customization templates into those directories. For example, 
          if you wanted to use the hook "end" in 
          <TT
CLASS="filename"
>global/useful-links.html.tmpl</TT
>, you would 
          create the directory <TT
CLASS="filename"
>BUGZILLA_ROOT/template/en/custom/hook/
          global/useful-links.html.tmpl/end/</TT
> and add your customization 
          template to this directory. 
        </P
><P
>&#13;          Obviously this method of customizing Bugzilla only lets you add code
          to the standard source files and templates; you cannot change the 
          existing code. Nevertheless, for those customizations that only add 
          code, this method can reduce conflicts when merging changes, 
          making upgrading your customized Bugzilla installation easier.

      Bugzilla has been
      designed to make it easy for you to write your own custom rules to define
      who is allowed to make what sorts of value transition.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      For maximum flexibility, customizing this means editing Bugzilla's Perl 
      code. This gives the administrator complete control over exactly who is
      allowed to do what. The relevant method is called
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>check_can_change_field()</TT
>,
      and is found in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>Bug.pm</TT

>&#13;      This function has been carefully commented to allow you to see exactly

      Certain marked sections should not be changed - these are
      the <SPAN

      It's fairly obvious what this piece of code does.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      So, how does one go about changing this function? Well, simple changes
      can be made just by removing pieces - for example, if you wanted to 
      prevent any user adding a comment to a bug, just remove the lines marked
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Allow anyone to change comments."</SPAN
> If you don't want the
      Reporter to have any special rights on bugs they have filed, just
      remove the entire section that deals with the Reporter.

><P
>&#13;      More complex customizations are not much harder. Basically, you add
      a check in the right place in the function, i.e. after all the variables
      you are using have been set up. So, don't look at $ownerid before 
      $ownerid has been obtained from the database. You can either add a
      positive check, which returns 1 (allow) if certain conditions are true,
      or a negative check, which returns 0 (deny.) E.g.:

            We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
            other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please get
            in touch. In the experience of Matthew Barnson (the original
            author of this FAQ), though, Bugzilla offers superior
            performance on commodity hardware, better price (free!), more
            developer-friendly features (such as stored queries, email
            integration, and platform independence), improved scalability,
            greater flexibility, and superior ease-of-use when compared
            to commercial bug-tracking software.

            It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
            have not yet found it. While Bugzilla makes strides in usability,
            customizability, scalability, and user interface with each release,
            that doesn't mean it can't still use improvement!

>&#13;            The best way to make an enhancement request is to <A
HREF="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla"
TARGET="_top"
>file
            a bug at bugzilla.mozilla.org</A
> and set the Severity
            to 'enhancement'. Your 'request for enhancement' (RFE) will
            start out in the UNCONFIRMED state, and will stay there until
            someone with the ability to CONFIRM the bug reviews it.
            If that person feels it to be a good request that fits in with
            Bugzilla's overall direction, the status will be changed to
            NEW; if not, they will probably explain why and set the bug
            to RESOLVED/WONTFIX. If someone else has made the same (or
            almost the same) request before, your request will be marked
            RESOLVED/DUPLICATE, and a pointer to the previous RFE will be
            added.

><P
>&#13;            Even if your RFE gets approved, that doesn't mean it's going
            to make it right into the next release; there are a limited
            number of developers, and a whole lot of RFEs... some of
            which are <EM
>quite</EM
> complex. If you're a
            code-hacking sort of person, you can help the project along
            by making a patch yourself that supports the functionality
            you require. If you have never contributed anything to

            MySQL is the default database for Bugzilla. It was originally chosen 
            because it is free, easy to install, and was available for the hardware

            seriously as if you were running MySQL.

            properly under SELinux. This should happen automatically
            on distributions that use SELinux and that package Bugzilla
            (if it is installed with the native package management tools).

            Bugzilla can output buglists as HTML (the default), CSV or RDF.
            The link for CSV can be found at the bottom of the buglist in HTML
            format. This CSV format can easily be imported into MS Excel or
            other spreadsheet applications.

            is meant to be machine readable and thus it is assumed that the

            It all depends on your level of commitment. Someone with much
            Bugzilla experience can get you up and running in less than a day,
            and your Bugzilla install can run untended for years. If your
            Bugzilla strategy is critical to your business workflow, hire
            somebody to who has reasonable Perl skills, and a familiarity
            with the operating system on which Bugzilla will be running,
            and have them handle your process management, bug-tracking
            maintenance, and local customization.

            Does Bugzilla provide record locking when there is simultaneous

            Bugzilla does not lock records. It provides mid-air collision
            detection -- which means that it warns a user when a commit is
            about to conflict with commits recently made by another user,
            and offers the second user a choice of options to deal with
            the conflict.

            The user can stop Bugzilla from sending any mail by unchecking
            all boxes on the 'Edit prefs' -&#62; 'Email settings' page.
            (As of 2.18,this is made easier by the addition of a 'Disable
            All Mail' button.) Alternately, you can add their email address
            to the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>data/nomail</TT
> file (one email address
            per line). This will override their personal preferences, and
            they will never be sent mail again.

            There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also
            generally not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what
            you're doing. If you understand SQL, though, you can use the
            <B
CLASS="command"
>mysql</B
> or <B
CLASS="command"
>psql</B
> command line 
            utilities to manually insert, delete and modify table information. 
            There are also more intuitive GUI clients available for both MySQL 
            and PostgreSQL. For MySQL, we recommend
            <A

            Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.
            Synchronization will only work one way -- you can create
            a read-only copy of the database at one site, and have it
            regularly updated at intervals from the main database.

            Making Bugzilla work easily with Windows
            was one of the major goals of the 2.18 milestone. If the
            necessary components are in place (perl, a webserver, an MTA, etc.)
            then installation of Bugzilla on a Windows box should be no more
            difficult than on any other platform. As with any installation,
            we recommend that you carefully and completely follow the
            installation instructions in <A

            Not currently. Bundle::Bugzilla enormously simplifies Bugzilla
            installation on UNIX systems. If someone can volunteer to
            create a suitable PPM bundle for Win32, it would be appreciated.

            Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to
            configure the Web server to treat *.cgi files as CGI scripts.
            In IIS, you do this by adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with
            the &#60;path&#62;\perl.exe %s %s as the executable.

>&#13;            The logic behind the page checks every bug in the list to
            determine legal state changes, and then only shows you controls
            to do things that could apply to <EM
>every</EM
> bug
            on the list. The reason for this is that if you try to do something
            illegal to a bug, the whole process will grind to a halt, and all
            changes after the failed one will <EM
>also</EM
> fail.
            Since that isn't a good outcome, the page doesn't even present
            you with the option.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            In practical terms, that means that in order to mark
            multiple bugs as CLOSED, then every bug on the page has to be
            either RESOLVED or VERIFIED already; if this is not the case,
            then the option to close the bugs will not appear on the page.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            The rationale is that if you pick one of the bugs that's not
            VERIFIED and try to CLOSE it, the bug change will fail
            miserably (thus killing any changes in the list after it
            while doing the bulk change) so it doesn't even give you the
            choice.

      many mails were sent and how many people were excluded. (Individual

          known bug before the release. Naturally, that hadn't actually
          happened.  (This is not unique to Netscape or to 4.0; the same thing
          has happened with every software project I've ever seen.)  Anyway,
          at the release party, T-shirts were handed out that said something
          like "Netscape 4.0: Zarro Boogs". Just like the software, the
          T-shirt had no known bugs.  Uh-huh.
